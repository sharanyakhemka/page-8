            <p>The first masterpiece on the list is German painter Carl Spitzweg’s work called The Poor Poet. Spitzweg’s piece is often seen as comedic because of the old umbrella that’s shown as magically floating in the air. Many art historians think that Spitzweg wanted to depict a starving artist. The work was stolen twice. The first happened in December of 1976. The unlikely thief was a German performance artist called Ulay. Around midday, Ulay walked into the National Gallery in Berlin, lifted the work off the wall, and simply walked out the emergency exit with it. In a bizarre twist, Ulay hung the painting in a friend’s home and told the police that he would return the work only if the director of the gallery came to look at it. The painting was successfully returned to the gallery. The painting was stolen once again by two thieves in disguise in the Schloss Charlottenburg’s Galerie der Romantik. It was never seen again.</p>

            <p>The second artwork on the list of missing masterpieces was made by the Flemish artist Jan Van Eyck and his brother Hubert. It’s The Ghent Altarpiece which is also known as the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. This religious artwork consists of 12 individual oil-painted panels that were put together to create one large scene. The 12-panel painting was created for the cathedral of St. Bavo in Ghent. It depicted many religious scenes in each panel. The center panel, also the largest one, shows people paying homage to their god. The other scenes include biblical scenes showing Adam and Eve, Jesus Christ wearing a crown, and John the Baptist. This piece is considered one of the most important works of its time. The entire masterpiece, when opened, was at least 11 feet tall and 15 feet wide. So, how was such a large and heavy painting stolen multiple times? The Ghent Altarpiece’s troubles started in 1566 when Protestant militants stormed the St. Bravo cathedral. Luckily, the guards of the cathedral managed to dismantle all 12 panels and hide the artwork away safely.</p>

            <p>Rembrandt van Rijn is known for his famous paintings that contain biblical scenes and religious figures. During his career, Rembrandt only painted one seascape known as The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The painting shows the Biblical story of Jesus calming the sea. The scene depicts Jesus Christ and his disciples caught out in a storm while sailing the sea of Galilee. According to Matthew 8:23-27, Jesus calmed the sea and left his disciples in awe. This moody seascape of Rembrandt’s was stolen from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. At the time, this was one of the biggest art heists in the USA. The painting was stolen by two men who posed as police officers. They were allowed into the museum by museum workers because of this. The workers were shocked when the fake police officers tied them up and started cutting out the paintings from their frames. In total, 13 artworks were stolen.</p>

            <p>'Poppies', painted by Vincent van Gogh, showcases his signature brushwork and vivid color palette. Mohamed Khalil Museum in Cairo obtained the $55 million painting and had it proudly on display until 4 June 1977 when the beloved painting was stolen. At the time, the government gave no details about the crime, but the theft was thought to have happened during a move between the museum’s two palaces. The Egyptian government could only offer a theory about a group of bandits who stole the painting. However, the painting was eventually recovered two years later in Kuwait. The location of where the painting was found was never disclosed to the public. </p>
